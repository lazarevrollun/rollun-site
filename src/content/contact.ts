/**
 * Contact content atoms (Story 6.3).
 *
 * The SINGLE typed home (AD-7/AD-14) of every static string the Contact page
 * (`/contact`) renders in its Hero (01) and Map (03) sections — ported VERBATIM
 * from the two Handoff prototypes:
 *   desktop → rollun_handoff/rollun-web-site/project/Contact.html
 *   mobile  → rollun_handoff/rollun-web-site/project/Contact Mobile.html
 *
 * The page (`app/(site)/contact/page.tsx`) and every section component in
 * `components/contact/*` read from THIS module. The shape is FLAT SERIALIZABLE
 * DATA (strings / arrays / objects — no functions, no JSX) so a future Payload
 * Global `ContactContent` (Phase 2) can supply the very same shape (AD-7). The
 * inline form/info card is Epic 2's `ContactInline` and does NOT read this
 * module — it keeps its own content atoms (`contact-form.ts`/`contact-info.ts`).
 *
 * AD-13 (start-src typo, reproduced VERBATIM, NOT fixed): `map.initialSrc` is a
 * standalone literal whose query reads `q=53%2F27%20Aldine…` — it deliberately
 * does NOT match `map.tabs[0].q` (`5327 Aldine…`). On load, tab 0 is `active`
 * but the iframe shows the typo; clicking tab 0 rebuilds the URL through
 * `encodeURIComponent(tabs[0].q)` and "corrects" it to `5327 Aldine…` — exactly
 * the prototype behaviour. Do NOT collapse `initialSrc` to `tabs[0].q`.
 *
 * Story 7.1: the passport atoms (the hero's opening hours, the two map tabs'
 * addresses) moved to `SiteSettings` (their single home, AD-14). `buildContactContent(s)`
 * composes `hero.intro` (code prose + `hours.contact`) and each `map.tabs[].addr/q`
 * from the passport addresses — reproducing the deliberate divergences verbatim
 * (tab[1] `addr` has NO comma between city and state; `q` does). The tab labels,
 * `map.eyebrow`/`title`, and the `initialSrc` typo literal stay code-owned (AD-6/AD-13).
